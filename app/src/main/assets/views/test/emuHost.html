<h3>Emulator host {{IsConnected}}</h3>
<p>
    When the app is running in an emulator, we <i>should</i> be
    able to access services running on the host machine.
</p>
<p>
    That means, if you're running this on your development machine,
    we can contact the host.
</p>
<p>
    This might give us the ability to 'hot reload' the current page.
    As long as we keep hold of the original model, we could re-run
    the templating and display step if a file-change poll signalled
    us to. We might also be able to request asset files from the
    host machine, which would allow css, templates, or images to be
    hot loaded.
</p>
<p>
    If we were attached to an on-device service (see <i>MiniTwins</i> project),
    then we could run in production like this, syncing templates and JS as
    required on the fly. Any Java file changes would probably need to be updated
    by APK as usual -- unless we can find a way to fiddle that too.

Time when page rendered:
<ul>
    <li>Android app: {{SelfTime}}</li>
    <li>Host PC: {{HostTime}}</li>
</ul>
Time on host now: <span id="timeNow">Waiting</span>

<script>
    function checkTime(){
        var result = manager.queryHost("time") || "not connected?"; // read from emulation host, if available
        document.getElementById('timeNow').innerText = result;
    }
    setInterval(checkTime, 1000);
</script>
