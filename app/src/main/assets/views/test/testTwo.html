<h1>Test page two</h1>
<p>
    This is a small test page to demonstrate end-of-path behaviour.
</p>
<p>
    This is how you can end a sequence of pages that the user should not
    be able to 'back' through.
</p>
<p>
    You can also clear the 'back' history at any time by calling
    <tt>manager.clearHistory()</tt> in JavaScript
</p>
<p>
    <a href="app://test/testTwo">Press here</a> to end your journey.
    Then try using the Android back arrow.
