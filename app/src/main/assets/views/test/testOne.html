<h1>Test page one</h1>
<p>
    This is a small test page to demonstrate that you
    can use the Android 'back' button to escape from
    pages that don't give you a link out.
</p>
<p>
    This isn't something you should actually do.
    Make sure you <i>at least</i> give a link to <tt>app://home</tt>
