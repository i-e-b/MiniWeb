<h1>Test of model paths</h1>
<a href="app://home">Home</a>
<p>
    This page contains a set of template replacement samples.
    You can look in the file at <tt>assets/views/test/modelPaths.html</tt>
    to see how it works in code, and for some extra notes.
</p>

<h2>Templating</h2>

<p>This is {{an}} example of {{multiple}} replacement{{s}} in a single {{line}}.</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;
{{an}} example of starting a line with a hole,
    and having a hole at the end of a {{line}}
</p>
<p>
    You can use dotted paths to reach into objects. It's better to avoid this and
    have a simpler flat structure -- but the feature is available: <i>{{pathPoints.name}}</i>.
    You can reach into more complex structures like
    <tt>nestedRepeat.0.children.1 = &quot;{{nestedRepeat.0.children.1}}&quot;</tt>
    (note iterables are zero-indexed)
    or
    <tt>mapNest.myKey.name = &quot;{{mapNest.myKey.name}}&quot;</tt>,
    but this is slower to render and more complex to use.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to display a '{​{' or '}&ZeroWidthSpace;​}' in your output, place a zero-width join character between them.
    This is Unicode character <code>\u200B</code>,
    which can be added to HTML with <code>&amp;ZeroWidthSpace;</code>, <code>&amp;#8203;</code> or <code>&amp;#x200B;</code>
</p>
<h2>for: and item:</h2>
<p>Look at the html template to see how this works</p>
<ul>
    <!-- Using 'for':
         Note that the '{{for:...}}', '{{else:...}}', and '{{end:...}}'
         MUST be on their own line, with no other text, elements, or comments.
         The template engine isn't very smart, and it will try to fill templates if it finds them in comments.
    -->

    <!-- After the 'for:', give the name of a field in the model.
         If the object is a list (or other kind of `Iterable`)
         the contents will be repeated for each item.
    -->
    {{for:listThing}}
        <!-- '{{item:...}}' is used to get values from the field of the closest '{{for:...}}'
             You can't read from a parent 'for'. Extend your view model instead -->
        <li>{{item:exampleField}}</li>
    {{end:listThing}}

    {{for:an}}
        <li>I only show when 'an' is not null</li>

        <!-- for blocks can nest, but NOT inside any other block for the same item -->

        <!-- If the object is a boolean, the contents will show only
             when the value is `true` -->
        {{for:falseValue}}
            <li>I only show when 'falseValue' is not false. So you can't see me?!</li>
        {{end:falseValue}}

        {{for:trueValue}}
            <li>I only show when 'trueValue' is not false. So you can see me.</li>
        {{end:trueValue}}
    {{end:an}}

    <!-- If the object is anything other than a boolean or iterable,
         the contents are shown only once, and
         only if the object is not null -->
    {{for:nullValue}}
        <li>I only show when 'nullValue' is not null. So you can't see me?!</li>
    {{end:nullValue}}
</ul>

<h2>Complex repeating</h2>
<p>Here we iterate over an object, and then iterate through child objects.</p>
{{for:nestedRepeat}}
    <h4>{{item:name}}</h4>
    <p>This is {{item:name}} it has child items:</p>
    <ol>
        {{for:item:children}}
            <!-- 'item:' with no field name returns the item's .toString value.
                 Useful if the child is a simple value, like in this case.

                 Note that {{item:...}} *here* can only refer to items in `nestedRepeat.children`
                 You can't access multiple levels at once. If you find you need this, copy
                 references down from upper to lower objects in your model. -->
            <li>{{item:}}</li>
        {{end:item:children}}
    </ol>
{{end:nestedRepeat}}

<h2>Fallback 'else'</h2>
<p>
    Each <code>{​{for:...}​}</code> block can have an <code>{​{else:...}​}</code>
    If that block would show no items (i.e. the object is null, empty, or false), then
    the contents of the 'else' section will show.
</p>
<ol>
    <_>field</_> <!-- model.field -->
    <_for emptyList>
        <li><_item/></li> <!-- the repeater item itself -->
        <li><_item>field</_item></li> <!-- for->item.field -->
    </_for>
    {{for:emptyList}}
        <li>{{item:}}</li>
    {{else}}
        <li>There are no items in this list</li>
    {{end}}
</ol>
<p>
    The 'for' section and 'else' section of a <code>{​{for:...}​}</code> are exclusive,
    and will never show at the same time.
