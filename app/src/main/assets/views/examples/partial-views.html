<h1>Partial Views</h1>
<a href="app://home">Home</a>
<p>
    This feature is not yet implemented. Once it is,
    you should see some items below

    <b>NOTE</b>: Editing any of the sub-views should trigger a hot-reload.
</p>
<!-- Using 'view':
     Note that the '{{view:...}}'
     MUST be on its own line, with no other text, elements, or comments.
     The template engine isn't very smart, and it will try to fill templates if it finds them in comments.

     '{{view:...}}' blocks can run in two modes: files and request.

     For 'file', the 'view' should have two parameters, 'model' and 'path'.

     'path' is the view to render. This should be a path to a html file in
     the assets folder. This will have template replacement applied and the
     result will be injected directly into the outer page.

     'model' is the data to supply to the templating.
     If model is not supplied, 'null' will be passed to the template engine.
     You can use 'item' when in a 'for:' list.
     You can use 'model' for the entire view model.
     If the model path can't be found, 'null' is passed.

     For 'request', the 'view' should have one parameter: 'url'.

     'url' is the Url (including query params if needed). This will be used
     to pass a GET request to a controller, which is responsible to rendering
     the result that will be injected directly into the outer page.
-->
<h2>View using a template file:</h2>
<p>
    {{view: model=model.subViewData, path=views/examples/a-sub-view.html}}
    <br/>The content of a view will be added directly to the parent page, so you should not
    have <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags in the view.
</p>
<p>
    If the path given to a <code>{​{view:...}​}</code> is not found, it
    will be re-tried with <code>.html</code> added (but it's better to get the path exactly correct).
    You can also use the top-level model from the page:<br/>
    {{view: model=model, path=views/examples/a-sub-view}}
</p>

<h2>View using a URL</h2>
<p>
    A URL view is read by sending a 'get' request through the <code>AppWebRouter</code>
    {{view: url=app://examples/url-view}}
    You can't pass a model into a URL view, but you can give it query parameters, and
    the controller can run code.
    {{view: url=app://examples/url-view?text=hello}}
    Editing the view used by the controller will result in a hot-reload.
</p>
<p>
    You can also pass query parameters to a URL view using 'model'.
    The <i>direct</i> fields will be added to the query parameters, but
    not any child fields.
    {{view: model=model, url=app://examples/url-view?text2=hello}}
</p>

<h2>Repeating views</h2>
<p>
    Views can be repeated by embedding in a <code>for</code> list:
</p>
<ul>
    {{for:listOfThings}}
    <li>
        {{view: model=item, path=views/examples/element-view.html}}
    </li>
    {{end:listOfThings}}
</ul>

<p>
    URL views can also be repeated in a <code>for</code>, the model will be passed in as query args (if given):
</p>
<ul>
    {{for:listOfThings}}
    <li>
        {{view: model=item, url=app://examples/element-view}}
    </li>
    {{end:listOfThings}}
</ul>

<h2>Error handling and invalid uses</h2>
<p>
    This is what a view looks like if no matching path is found:<br/>
    {{view: model=model.subViewData, path=not-a-path/not-a-view}}
</p>
<p>
    This is what a URL view looks like if the controller crashes:<br/>
    {{view: url=app://test/bad-method}}
</p>
<p>
    This is what a view looks like if neither a path nor a url is given:<br/>
    {{view: model=model.what}}
</p>
<p>
    This is what a view looks like if the 'item' model is used outside of a 'for' block:<br/>
    {{view: model=item, path=views/examples/a-sub-view.html}}
    <br/> which results in the view being called with <code>null</code> as the model.
