    <!-- Using 'partial':
         Note that the '{{partial:...}}'
         MUST be on its own line, with no other text, elements, or comments.
         The template engine isn't very smart, and it will try to fill templates if it finds them in comments.

         The 'partial' should have two value, 'model' and 'path'.

         'path' is the view to render. This should be a path to an asset.
         This asset will have template replacement applied and then will be injected
         directly into the outer page.

         'model' is the data to supply to the templating.
         If model is not supplied, 'null' will be passed to the template engine.
         You can use 'item' when in a 'for:' list.
         You can use 'model' for the entire view model.
         If the model path can't be found, 'null' is passed.
