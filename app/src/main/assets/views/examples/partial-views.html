<h1>Partial Views</h1>
<a href="app://home">Home</a>
<p>
    MiniWeb can inject one page inside another.
    This is mostly useful when making a 'partial view' page that
    encompasses a single control, or a common page fragment.
</p>
<!-- Using 'view':
     Note that the '{{view:...}}'
     MUST be on its own line, with no other text, elements, or comments.
     The template engine isn't very smart, and it will try to fill templates if it finds them in comments.

     '{{view:...}}' blocks can run in two modes: HTML files and URL requests.

     * For 'file', the 'view' can have two parameters, 'path' and 'model'.

         'path' - required: the view to render. This should be a path to a html file in
         the assets folder. This will have template replacement applied and the
         result will be injected directly into the outer page.

         'model' - optional: the data to supply to the templating.
         If model is not supplied, 'null' will be passed to the template engine.
         You can use 'item' when in a 'for:' list.
         You can use 'model' for the entire view model.
         If the model path can't be found, 'null' is passed.

     * For 'request', the 'view' can have two parameters, 'url' and 'model'.

         'url' - required: the Url to a view (including query params if needed).
         This will be used to pass a GET request to a controller, which is
         responsible for rendering the result that will be injected directly
         into the outer page.

         'model' - optional: if given, the fields on this object will be
         added to the url being requested. All fields will be directly
         converted to strings. Child containers will NOT be recursively added.

<h2>View using a template file:</h2>
<p>
    The content of a view will be added directly to the parent page, so you should not
    have <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags in the view.
    {{view: model=model.subViewData, path=views/examples/a-sub-view.html}}
</p>
<p>
    You can also use the top-level model from the page:
    {{view: model=model, path=views/examples/a-sub-view.html}}
    which also has a short-cut form:
    {{view: model, path=views/examples/a-sub-view.html}}
</p>
<p>
    If the path given to a <code>{​{view:...}​}</code> is not found, it
    will be retried with <code>.html</code> added (but it's better to get the path exactly correct):
    {{view: path=views/examples/a-sub-view}}
</p>

<h2>View using a URL</h2>
<p>
    A URL view is read by sending a 'get' request through the <code>AppWebRouter</code>
    {{view: url=app://examples/url-view}}
    You can't pass a model into a URL view, but you can give it query parameters, and
    the controller can run code.
    {{view: url=app://examples/url-view?text=hello}}
    Editing the view used by the controller will result in a hot-reload.
</p>
<p>
    You can also pass query parameters to a URL view using 'model'.
    The <i>direct</i> fields will be added to the query parameters, but
    not any child fields.
    {{view: model=model, url=app://examples/url-view?text2=hello}}
</p>

<h2>Repeating views</h2>
<p>
    Views can be repeated in a <code>{​{for:...}​}</code> list:
</p>
<ul>
    {{for:listOfThings}}
    <li>
        {{view: model=item, path=views/examples/element-view.html}}
    </li>
    {{end:listOfThings}}
</ul>

<p>
    URL views can also be repeated in a <code>{​{for:...}​}</code>.<br/>
    If given, the model will be passed in as query args.
</p>
<ul>
    {{for:listOfThings}}
    <li>
        {{view: model=item, url=app://examples/element-view}}
    </li>
    {{end:listOfThings}}
</ul>

<h2>Error handling and invalid uses</h2>
<p>DO NOT DO ANY OF THESE, even if they seem to work</p>
<p>
    This is what a view looks like if no matching path is found:<br/>
    {{view: model=model.subViewData, path=not-a-path/not-a-view}}
    <br/>If you get a path wrong, or use a path to a file you haven't made yet,
    the target will not be registered for hot-reload.
</p>
<p>
    This is what a URL view looks like if the controller crashes:<br/>
    {{view: url=app://test/bad-method}}
</p>
<p>
    This is what a view looks like if neither a path nor a url is given:<br/>
    {{view: model=model.what}}
</p>
<p>
    This is what a view looks like if the 'item' model is used outside of a 'for' block:<br/>
    {{view: model=item, path=views/examples/a-sub-view.html}}
    (this results in the view being called with <code>null</code> as the model)
